    "α - equilibrium fractionation factor at given temperature. Craig Gordon uses superscript * for α < 1 and superscript + for α>1 In phase transitions of water, resultant changes in hydrogen and oxygen isotopes can differ by almost a factor of 10. Differences in fractionation factor are an order of mag higher for hydrogen isotopologues (figure 3.1 p 25). α = R2/R1 where R2 and R1 are ratios of isotopes to common species between two phases 1 and 2\n",
